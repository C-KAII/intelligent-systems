# ["Help the Robot" Pathfinding Project](/path-finding/)

This project involves developing an intelligent agent that navigates a topographic map to find an optimal path from a starting point to a destination using various search algorithms. The robot navigates based on terrain types and movement costs.

# [Decision Trees](/decision-trees/)

This task involves building a decision tree to classify US Congress members based on their voting patterns. The objective is to predict party affiliation using a dataset provided in `votes.csv`.

# [Neural Network Classification](/neural-network-classification/)

This task involves implementing a neural network from scratch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The neural network must be trained using stochastic gradient descent with specified hyperparameters.
