# Intelligent Systems - Decision Trees

## Overview

This task involves building a decision tree to classify US Congress members based on their voting patterns. The objective is to predict party affiliation using a dataset provided in `votes.csv`.

---

## Objectives

- Implement a decision tree from scratch.
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a learning curve.
- Randomly split the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Dataset**: `votes.csv` containing voting patterns and party labels.
2. **Decision Tree Construction**: Predict party affiliation.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Training/testing set size.
  - Total accuracy.
  - Confusion matrix.
  - Precision, recall, F1-score (macro & weighted averages).
  - Learning curve: Accuracy vs. number of training examples.
4. **Visualisation**: Use `matplotlib` to plot the learning curve.
